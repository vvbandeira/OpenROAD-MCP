# OpenROAD MCP Server

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.The-OpenROAD-Project/openroad-mcp -->

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) and [ORFS](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts).

## About OpenROAD MCP

**New here?** Check out the [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) to get your AI assistant analyzing designs in 5 minutes.

OpenROAD MCP eliminates the barrier between your AI assistant and physical design by connecting Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients directly to the OpenROAD layout tools.

OpenROAD is the leading open-source, foundational application for semiconductor digital design, delivering an Autonomous, No-Human-In-Loop (NHIL) flow from RTL-GDSII. OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS) is the fully autonomous flow built around it.

With this MCP server, your AI assistant can:
- **Execute Commands** - Run interactive OpenROAD sessions with full PTY support.
- **Manage Sessions** - Create, list, inspect, and terminate multiple physical design sessions.
- **Track History & Metrics** - Access full command history and performance metrics for analysis.
- **Visualize Reports** - List and read report images from ORFS runs directly in the chat.

## Requirements & Installation

To use this MCP server, you need the server runtime, plus the underlying OpenROAD layout tools.

### 1. Server Runtime
- **Node.js 22+** is required to run the `npx` distribution.

### 2. OpenROAD
**OpenROAD** must be installed and available in your `PATH`.
- [Official OpenROAD Installation Guide](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/Build.html)

### 3. OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS)
**ORFS** is optional but highly recommended for complete RTL-to-GDS flows and report visualization.
- [Official ORFS Local Build Guide](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildLocally.html)

### Alternative: Docker (no local OpenROAD/ORFS install)

Don't want to build OpenROAD locally? `pull_orfs_docker_image` and `create_docker_orfs_session`
run OpenROAD inside the official `openroad/orfs` Docker image instead — you only need Docker and
Node.js. Set `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=openroad,docker` and see the
[docker-orfs skill](skills/docker-orfs/SKILL.md) for the full workflow, or install the
[Claude Code Plugin](#claude-code-plugin) below, which enables this out of the box.

## Configuration

For platform-specific Node.js and C++ toolchain setup instructions, see the **[Cross-Platform Build Guide](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md)**.

Before configuring your MCP client, you must provide the server with your local paths to OpenROAD and ORFS.

### 1. Find Your Paths
Run these commands in your terminal to locate the necessary directories:

```bash
# Get your OpenROAD binary directory:
dirname $(which openroad)

# Check for the default ORFS flow directory:
ls ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow
# (If not found, search with: find ~ -maxdepth 4 -type d -name flow -path "*/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/*" 2>/dev/null)
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and fill in the paths you just found:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` to ensure `PATH` includes your OpenROAD binary directory, and `ORFS_FLOW_PATH` points to your ORFS checkout. Pass these values into your MCP client's configuration via the `env` block.

## Supported MCP Clients

Here is the standard base configuration used across most clients:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "openroad-mcp"]
}
```

Find your specific client below for the exact configuration snippet and file location. 

*(Note: If your client supports environment variables in the config, inject your `PATH` and `ORFS_FLOW_PATH` directly in the snippet).*

## Available Tools

Once configured, your AI assistant will have access to the following tools. For detailed parameters, schemas, and return formats, see the **[API Reference](docs/API.md)**.

- `interactive_openroad_query`
- `interactive_openroad_exec`
- `create_interactive_session`
- `list_interactive_sessions`
- `terminate_interactive_session`
- `inspect_interactive_session`
- `get_session_history`
- `get_session_metrics`
- `list_report_images`
- `read_report_image`
- `pull_orfs_docker_image`
- `create_docker_orfs_session`

## Claude Code Plugin

Install the MCP server and the [docker-orfs skill](skills/docker-orfs/SKILL.md) together in one
step:

```
/plugin marketplace add the-openroad-project/openroad-mcp
/plugin install openroad-mcp@openroad-plugins
```

This registers the server (`npx -y openroad-mcp`) with `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=openroad,docker`
set by default, so `create_docker_orfs_session` works immediately — no local OpenROAD/ORFS install
needed. Ask Claude to "run OpenROAD in Docker" or "pull the openroad/orfs image" to trigger the
skill, or invoke it directly with `/openroad-mcp:docker-orfs`.

## Troubleshooting

- **The server fails to start**: Ensure you have Node.js 22+. Older versions will fail.
- **Session creation fails**: Confirm `openroad` is on your `PATH`. The server spawns it by name; if it's missing, session creation (not startup) will fail.
- **Commands rejected with CommandBlocked**: You sent a state-modifying command to `interactive_openroad_query`. Use `interactive_openroad_exec` instead.
- **Report images not found**: Make sure `ORFS_FLOW_PATH` points to your ORFS `flow/` directory.
- **`create_docker_orfs_session` fails with `CommandBlocked`/not-allowed**: Set
  `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=openroad,docker` — `docker` isn't allowlisted by default.

To get more detail, set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in the server's environment.
