# OpenROAD MCP — Security Model

This document describes the security boundaries, access controls, and known exposure risks of the OpenROAD MCP server. It covers the Tcl command whitelist, the PTY spawn allowlist, every environment variable that affects security-relevant behaviour, path containment for report images, and the HTTP transport's exposure surface.

## Tcl Command Whitelist

The whitelist is implemented in
[`typescript/src/config/command_whitelist.ts`](../typescript/src/config/command_whitelist.ts). It
guards **Tcl statements** sent to the OpenROAD REPL, not the shell binary (that is the PTY spawn
allowlist below).

### Three-tier Design

**Tier 1 — `BLOCKED_COMMANDS` (denied in both tools)**

These are OS-level Tcl built-ins that can escape the EDA context regardless of OpenROAD's
own access controls.

| Command | Reason Blocked |
|---------|----------------|
| `quit` | terminates the OpenROAD process |
| `socket` | opens arbitrary network connections |
| `load` | loads compiled C extensions into the interpreter |
| `glob` | enumerates the filesystem |
| `fconfigure` | configures I/O channels |
| `chan` | channel operations |
| `vwait` | blocks the event loop indefinitely |
| `rename` | renames or deletes commands, bypassing top-level checks |
| `after` | schedules arbitrary code execution |
| `subst` | performs substitutions that can invoke arbitrary commands |

**Tier 2 — `EXEC_ONLY_PATTERNS` (denied in query, allowed in exec)**

These are explicitly state-modifying or file-system-touching commands. They are allowed in
`interactive_openroad_exec` and rejected in `interactive_openroad_query`.

Exact verbs: `exec`, `source`, `exit`, `open`, `close`, `file`, `cd`, `uplevel`

Wildcard patterns: `set_*`, `create_*`, `read_*`, `write_*`

Named flow commands: `initialize_floorplan`, `place_pins`, `global_placement`,
`detailed_placement`, `clock_tree_synthesis`, `global_route`, `detailed_route`,
`repair_design`, `repair_timing`, `repair_clock_nets`, `log_begin`, `log_end`

**Tier 3 — `READONLY_PATTERNS` (allowed in both tools)**

Wildcard patterns: `report_*`, `get_*`, `check_*`

Named commands: `estimate_parasitics`, `sta`, `help`, `version`

Safe Tcl built-ins: `puts`, `set`, `expr`, `return`, `break`, `continue`, `list`, `llength`,
`lindex`, `lappend`, `lrange`, `lsort`, `lsearch`, `lreplace`, `string`, `regexp`, `regsub`,
`format`, `scan`, `array`, `dict`, `error`, `upvar`, `global`, `variable`, `concat`, `join`,
`split`, `incr`, `append`, `info`, `unset`

**Unknown commands** are treated as exec-only: denied in query, allowed in exec. They will fail at
the Tcl level inside OpenROAD if they are not valid commands.

### Query versus Exec Enforcement

| Context | `interactive_openroad_query` | `interactive_openroad_exec` |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Default policy** | **deny** (only READONLY_PATTERNS pass) | **allow** (only BLOCKED_COMMANDS fail) |
| **Exec-only verbs** | rejected | allowed |
| **Unknown verbs** | rejected (treated as exec-only) | allowed |
| **Blocked verbs** | rejected | rejected |

When a command is rejected the tool returns a JSON response — no exception is thrown to the
client:

```json
{
  "output": "",
  "session_id": "sess-0001",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "execution_time": 0,
  "command_count": 0,
  "buffer_size": 0,
  "error": "CommandBlocked: 'exit'",
  "message": "Command blocked: 'exit' is not on the OpenROAD allowlist.\nFull command: 'exit'"
}
```

### Compound Statements and Bracket Substitution

The whitelist parses multi-statement input before checking:

- **Statement splitting** respects `"` quotes, `{}`  braces, and backslash escapes. It splits on
  `;`, `\n`, and a range of Unicode line separators.
- **Bracket substitution** (`[command ...]`) is scanned recursively — `set x [exec ls]` extracts
  verb `exec` from the inner command.
- **Body-eval builtins** (`if`, `for`, `foreach`, `while`, `proc`, `catch`, `namespace`) are not
  in `_TCL_BUILTINS`, so they reach the default "unknown → exec-only" path and are rejected in
  query.
- **`eval`** is not in `BLOCKED_COMMANDS`, so it is allowed in exec. In query it is rejected as
  unknown.
- **Backslash obfuscation** is neutralised: `tclUnescape()` normalises `\socket`, `\x73ocket`,
  and octal escapes before matching.
- **Comments** (lines starting with `#` and blank lines, including any brackets inside them) are
  skipped entirely.

### Disabling the Whitelist

Set `OPENROAD_WHITELIST_ENABLED=false` to skip all Tcl checks. Intended for trusted development
environments where the full ORFS Tcl API is needed without restriction. Never expose an
unwhitelisted server over HTTP without additional access controls.

## PTY Spawn Allowlist

A separate layer in
[`typescript/src/interactive/pty_handler.ts`](../typescript/src/interactive/pty_handler.ts)
guards the **shell binary and arguments** at session creation, independently of the Tcl whitelist.

When `OPENROAD_ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION=true` (default):

- The executable name must be in `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` (default: `["openroad"]`).
- No argument may contain shell metacharacters (`;`, `&`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$`, `\n`, `\r`).
- No argument may contain path traversal (`..`).
- No argument may contain redirection operators (`>`, `<`).

To allow additional executables (e.g. `sta`):

```bash
OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=openroad,sta
```

Set `OPENROAD_ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION=false` to skip spawn validation entirely.

## Environment Variable Reference

All variables are read at startup by [`typescript/src/config/settings.ts`](../typescript/src/config/settings.ts).

| Variable | Type | Default | What it gates |
|----------|------|---------|---------------|
| `OPENROAD_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | float (seconds) | `30.0` | Per-command timeout; override per-call with `timeout_ms` |
| `OPENROAD_COMMAND_COMPLETION_DELAY` | float (seconds) | `0.1` | Delay before declaring command completion. |
| `OPENROAD_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE` | integer (bytes) | `131072` (128 KiB) | Circular output buffer max size per session |
| `OPENROAD_MAX_SESSIONS` | integer | `50` | Maximum concurrent active sessions |
| `OPENROAD_SESSION_QUEUE_SIZE` | integer | `128` | Maximum pending commands in input queue |
| `OPENROAD_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | float (seconds) | `300.0` | Idle threshold; does **not** trigger automatic cleanup (see [Session Lifecycle Notes](API.md#session-lifecycle-notes)) |
| `OPENROAD_READ_CHUNK_SIZE` | integer (bytes) | `8192` | Max chunk size when splitting large PTY bursts |
| `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` | string (comma-separated) | `openroad` | PTY spawn executable allowlist |
| `OPENROAD_ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION` | bool | `true` | Enables/disables `PtyHandler.validateCommand` |
| `OPENROAD_WHITELIST_ENABLED` | bool | `true` | Enables/disables the Tcl command whitelist |
| `ORFS_FLOW_PATH` | path | `~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow` | Root for ORFS reports; tilde-expanded at runtime |
| `DOCKER_PULL_TIMEOUT_MS` | integer (ms) | `1200000` (20 min) | Timeout for `pull_orfs_docker_image`; override per-call with `timeout_ms` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | string | `INFO` | Root pino logger level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | string | (N/A) | Unused; logging uses pino with a fixed JSON format |

CLI flags `--verbose` and `--log-level` override `LOG_LEVEL` after the settings are initialised.
No other CLI flag overrides a Settings field.

## Report Image Path Containment

Report images are served from:

```
{ORFS_FLOW_PATH}/reports/{platform}/{design}/{run_slug}/
```

The containment enforcement in
[`typescript/src/utils/path_security.ts`](../typescript/src/utils/path_security.ts) works in
two layers:

**Layer 1 — Segment Validation** (applied to `run_slug` and `image_name` independently):

- Empty or whitespace-only value → rejected
- `.` or `..` → rejected
- Contains `/` or `\` → rejected
- Contains null byte `\x00` → rejected
- Contains glob characters `* ? [ ]` → rejected

**Layer 2 — Realpath Containment** (applied after joining paths):

The resolved real path (via `realpathSync`, with a walk-up for non-existent suffixes) must be
under the base directory. A symlink that points outside the base is caught here.

**Additional constraints:**

- Only `.webp` files are served — the listing skips all other extensions and `read_report_image`
  rejects any `image_name` that does not end in `.webp`.
- Symlinks are skipped during directory listing.
- On-disk file size is capped at 50 MB before any decoding.
- The base64-encoded payload is targeted at 15 KB; larger images are downscaled using sharp
  (lanczos3, WebP quality 85, minimum dimension 256 px).

**Known image filename mappings:**

Images are classified by filename stem: the `stage` is the prefix before the first `_`, and the
`type` is looked up in a fixed mapping. Filenames not in the mapping get `type: "unknown"`.
Recognised stems: `cts_clk`, `cts_clk_layout`, `cts_core_clock`, `cts_core_clock_layout`,
`final_all`, `final_clocks`, `final_congestion`, `final_ir_drop`, `final_placement`,
`final_resizer`, `final_routing`.

## Docker-backed Sessions

`create_docker_orfs_session` (see [docs/API.md](API.md#create_docker_orfs_session)) spawns
`docker run ...` through the same `PtyHandler` as every other session — it does not introduce a
separate execution path or its own sandbox.

- **`docker` must be explicitly allowlisted.** It is not in the default
  `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` (`openroad` only); set
  `OPENROAD_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=openroad,docker` to enable this tool.
- **The assembled `docker run` argv passes through the same PTY spawn arg validation** as any
  other command: no shell metacharacters, no redirection operators, no `..` path traversal (see
  [PTY Spawn Allowlist](#pty-spawn-allowlist) above). The tool itself additionally validates the
  image reference against a narrow allowlist pattern and requires `flow_dir` to be an existing
  absolute directory before it is used in a `-v` mount.
- **This changes the trust boundary, not the sandbox model.** Once `docker` is allowlisted, the
  Docker daemon and everything it can do (image pulls, bind mounts, container escape via a
  misconfigured or compromised image) becomes part of what a session can reach — the same "exec is
  not a sandbox" caveat below applies, just one layer further out. By default the container is
  started with `--network none`; pass `network: true` only if you understand that it removes this
  isolation.
- **`pull_orfs_docker_image`** runs `docker pull` directly via `child_process.spawn`, not through
  the PTY/whitelist machinery (it is a one-shot admin operation, not an OpenROAD session). It
  validates the image reference the same way before spawning.

---

## HTTP Transport Exposure

Start the server with `--transport http` (default `localhost:8000`) to expose it over Streamable
HTTP instead of stdio.

**There is no authentication, no CORS policy, and no DNS-rebinding protection in the application
code.** Any process that can reach `localhost:8000` can call any tool.

Practical guidance:

- Use HTTP mode only in trusted, isolated networks (local development, a private cluster with
  network policies).
- Add a reverse proxy with authentication (e.g. nginx + mTLS, Tailscale) if you need to expose
  the endpoint beyond localhost.
- The server creates a fresh MCP instance per request; session continuity is maintained via
  explicit `session_id` params, not HTTP session cookies.
- The request body is capped at 1 MB (`MAX_BODY_BYTES`); oversized requests are rejected with
  HTTP 400.

---

## Exec is Not a Sandbox

The whitelist is a guardrail against accidental misuse by AI agents, **not a security sandbox**.
It prevents the most obvious footguns (`quit`, network, `eval`-style injection) but it does not:

- Prevent OpenROAD from reading or writing files through its own C++ API.
- Prevent `exec` (allowed in exec tool) from spawning additional processes.
- Isolate the OpenROAD process from the host filesystem.
- Protect against a compromised or malicious `openroad` binary.

For a hardened deployment, run the server and OpenROAD inside a container with a restricted
filesystem mount and no network access beyond what ORFS requires.
